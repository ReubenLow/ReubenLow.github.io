I am currently pursuing a degree in Robotics Systems Engineering at the Singapore Institute of Technology.

During my polytechnic studies, I completed a six-month internship at the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC), where I was part of the Advanced Robotics Applications department. This experience allowed me to work on industrial robotics projects, providing valuable insights into the vast potential of robotics and its significant impact on improving quality of life.

These experiences have solidified my ambition to become a robotics engineer. I am committed to advancing my expertise in programming, electronics, and mechanical design to contribute meaningfully to the field of robotics.
