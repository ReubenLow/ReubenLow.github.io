<!-- Describe the objective of SEP2 -->
## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a system that enhances the presentation, customization, and efficiency of food preparation, while considering the needs of various stakeholders, such as restaurants, caterers, and consumers.

## Outcome
EASY, a food printer that is capable of printing 2D graphical images on a tray of pastries autonomously.

<!-- To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images. -->

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div> -->

<!-- The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above: -->

<!-- {% raw %} -->

<!-- ```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

</div>
``` -->
