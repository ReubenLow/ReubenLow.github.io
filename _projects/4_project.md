<!-- Describe the objective of SEP1 -->
## Objective
The objective of this project was to create a autonomous navigation system for a robotic platform using ROS 1. The robot, referred to as LIMO, was required to traverse a 3x3 arena map representing various zones in Sentosa. Additionally, this project aimed to introduce the concept of a throwaway prototype, focusing on testing and verifying the key functionalities of the system. The project was conducted as part of the Systems Engineering module.

## Outcome
The project successfully demonstrated the robot's ability to autonomously navigate to specified goals within the arena. The navigation system, built using ROS 1, allowed LIMO to accurately move to various zones of the arena.
