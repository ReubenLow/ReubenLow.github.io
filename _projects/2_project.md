<!-- Describe the objective of MAL -->
## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Value-Added Service (VAS) assembly line at a third party logistics company. The current assembly line faced significant challenges, particularly in handling High Mix Low Volume (HMLV) Stock Keeping Units (SKU) through predominantly manual processes, which caused bottlenecks and inefficiencies. The project aimed to address these issues by proposing a modular and scalable automation solution to improve throughput, reduce manual labor, and integrate emerging technologies seamlessly.

## Outcome
The project team successfully designed and developed a prototype of a Modular Assembly Line (MAL) that significantly improves the existing VAS assembly line. Key outcomes include:

1. Increased Throughput: The MAL system demonstrated a 30% increase in hourly throughput compared to the existing system, producing 8,352 kit boxes in an 8-hour shift versus 6,807 kit boxes by the current assembly line.
2. Cost Efficiency: The MAL system's automation led to a substantial reduction in operating costs, saving approximately $59,240 per annum due to reduced reliance on manual labor.
3. Return on Investment (ROI): The MAL system is projected to become more cost-effective than the existing system within three years, achieving a quicker ROI due to lower operational costs.
